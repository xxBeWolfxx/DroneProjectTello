# Tello project
This repository contains university project. We have based our idea on repository of [easyTello](https://github.com/Virodroid/easyTello) on GitHub. I have created project to control a Tello drone by special QR codes which contains a special mission.

## Extended module
We have extended _easyTello_ modules by adding our module TelloBird which contains our protocols of missions. Every mission is triggered by QR code, which is exclusive for each task.
